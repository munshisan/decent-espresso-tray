# decent-espresso-tray

This project contains files to print a waste tray and related parts to be used with [Decent Espresso's DE1](https://decentespresso.com) machine together with [Decent's bluetooth scale](https://decentespresso.com/decentscale).

## Motivation
The motivation for this project was [explained here](https://3.basecamp.com/3671212/buckets/7351439/messages/5296473889) but I'll copy/paste the relevant bits below.

> Headline: I've replaced the Decent drip tray with a 3D printed tray that sits above the Decent Scale (DS). This stackup has been working well for me -- from pulling shots by weight, to steaming milk, refilling water,  flushing/routine maintenance, etc. (My DE1 is not plumbed.)

> Pros of this setup:
* Brew by weight
* Everything stays put nicely and looks neat
* The scale is not exposed to liquids/steam
* The static weight of everything above the scale (minus the SS tray cover) is about 130g
* Slightly more headroom above the tray (useful for doing a pour-overs, say)
