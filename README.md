# decent-espresso-tray

This project contains files to print a waste tray and related parts to be used with [Decent Espresso's DE1](https://decentespresso.com) machine together with [Decent's bluetooth scale](https://decentespresso.com/decentscale).

## Motivation
The motivation for this project was [explained here](https://3.basecamp.com/3671212/buckets/7351439/messages/5296473889) but I'll copy/paste the relevant bits below.

> Headline: I've replaced the Decent drip tray with a 3D printed tray that sits above the Decent Scale (DS). This stackup has been working well for me -- from pulling shots by weight, to steaming milk, refilling water,  flushing/routine maintenance, etc. (My DE1 is not plumbed.)

> Pros of this setup:
> * Brew by weight
> * Everything stays put nicely and looks neat
> * The scale is not exposed to liquids/steam
> * The static weight of everything above the scale (minus the SS tray cover) is about 130g
> * Slightly more headroom above the tray (useful for doing a pour-overs, say)

To summarize, this stackup allows the Decent Scale to sit beneath, fitted to, the new drip-tray, in a ready-to-brew configuration. The stackup can be easily moved ouf the way to refill the water tank and the tray can be easily removed and refitted to the scale for emptying or cleaning the former.

## How it works

The Decent Scale has a grippy, rubberized coating on its base to sit securely on most countertop surfaces.

In this stackup, the scale cover is placed over the scale. 

The scale cover should be printed in TPU95A or similar material that allows the scale cover to stretch and grip the scale. The scale cover should be adhesively bonded to the drip-tray, so the scale cover and tray are a unitary piece. The drip-tray can be printed in any material that is non-porous. I have printed it in high temperature PLA successfully (prints with CPE were a failure as CPE is porous).

The wire guide (aka wire stent) is necessary when connecting the scale to a USB power supply as any physical interference between the cable and the scale's cover will produce erroneous readings. 

The waste chute extends the waste discharge exit point to the front of the enclosure and thus over the drip tray, allowing the drip tray to capture all the discharge.
